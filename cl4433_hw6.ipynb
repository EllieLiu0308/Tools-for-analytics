    "Please read the following instructions thoroughly. Neglecting to do so may result in missed points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preamble\n",
    "**Reminder**: Homeworks are due by 7:00PM ET on Sundays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you turn this problem set in, make sure everything runs as expected. First, **restart the kernel** (in the menubar, select Kernel$\\rightarrow$Restart) and then **run all cells** (in the menubar, select Cell$\\rightarrow$Run All).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming conventions\n",
    "Be sure the filename of your notebook is in the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <uni>_<assignment>_<details [optional]>.<extension>\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    lr3086_hw01.ipynb\n",
    "    lr3086_hw01_complete.ipynb\n",
    "    LR3086_HW01.ipynb\n",
    "    \n",
    "To rename a notebook, in the menubar, select File$\\rightarrow$Rename. The extension for notebook files, `.ipynb`, will already be appended to the filename, but will be hidden from view within the notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This naming format allows for autograding of all assignments. If your files are not named with this format, you should expect a grade of zero for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Courseworks may rename your file to something like `lr3086_hw0-1.ipynb` if you resubmit your assignment. This is perfectly fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Format To Submit In\n",
    "\n",
    "Most homeworks are in Jupyter notebooks. Once you've finished your homework, unless specified otherwise, please download your work as an `.ipynb` file to your local machine, then upload it to Courseworks when complete (in the menubar, select File$\\rightarrow$Download as$\\rightarrow$Notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Failure to submit a Jupyter notebook will result in a grade of zero for the assignment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible points on late assignments are deducted by 50% for each day they are late. For example, if you get 80% of the total possible credits on a homework but hand in that homework a day late, you would get 40%. Assignments two days late get zero points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once solutions are posted and graded assignments are handed back, students have 1 week to bring their grading discrepancies to a CA for consideration of possible grading errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because grading is automated, please delete (or comment out) the `raise NotImplmeneted` code before attempting a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty un-editable cells in an assignment are there for a reason. They will be filled with tests by the automatic grader. Please do not attempt to remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Help\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking for help is a great way to increase your chance of success. However there are some rules. When asking for help (especially from a fellow student), *you can show your helper your code but you can not view theirs*. You work needs to be your own. You can not post screenshots of your current work to Ed Discussions or other tools used for getting help.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to reach out to a CA for help, please do so via Ed Discussions and not via email. Answers given via Ed Discussions will help you as well as other students. Thus, emails will always have a lower priority for response than Ed Discussions questions. If you do email the CA, please make a note of what section you are in. This helps us identify you in Courseworks faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you do not get a repsonse from a CA within 48 hours, you may email the professor."
